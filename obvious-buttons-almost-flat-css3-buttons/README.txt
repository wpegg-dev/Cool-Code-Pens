A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/wpegg/pen/WvvwaP.

 A repost of a bunch of CSS buttons I found on GitHub, made by @skidding. Planning to contribute on developing this project further. It would mean a lot if you guys could check these out and give suggestions on what can be improved. Any feedback is useful. Thanks! 

Forked from [Valentin Radulescu](http://codepen.io/RadValentin/)'s Pen [Obvious Buttons - Almost Flat CSS3 Buttons](http://codepen.io/RadValentin/pen/kahKl/).
