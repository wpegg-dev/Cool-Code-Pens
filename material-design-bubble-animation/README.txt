A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/wpegg/pen/Byerxx.

 When a button is pressed, the background changes with the iconic Material Design animation. This can also be applied for other uses (buttons etc.).

Forked from [Ives van Hoorne](http://codepen.io/CompuIves/)'s Pen [Material Design Bubble Animation](http://codepen.io/CompuIves/pen/RNmwKV/).
